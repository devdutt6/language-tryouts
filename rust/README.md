# Rust

I wanted to learn rust to use it for a small WASM(Web Assembly) project so that i understand new technology as i was having deficulty understanding it.

So i had to choose some new non-browser native (non-js) language which is supported by WASM so then came rust.

I started learning rust because i came to know that it is **memory-safe** and **blazingly fast** which i find are two of the most important points for gaining its popularity and acceptablity in development environment and this are also the to reasons which keeps developers err on the side of caution :wink:.

Rust also has great documentation and very friendly community around it so other developers will follow in stride.

It also has [cargo](https://crates.io/) which is rust community's crate registry like npm, yarn for javascript.
